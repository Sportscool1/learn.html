								<p> Html or HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the backbone of the web, providing the content, as well as the structure of that content, that you see displayed in your web browser. this content is made up of various HTML elements and text. HTML is the content layer of the web. HTML elements are the nodes that make up the Document Object Model.

Cascading Style Sheets provide the look and feel, or presentation layer of the page. JavaScript is the behavior layer, often used to manipulate the objects within a document. Sites that are built with JavaScript frameworks are really just manipulating HTML. In turn, it's important to mark up your HTML in a way that scripts can easily parse and that assistive technologies can easily understand. This means writing HTML code with modern standards.

								<h2>Servers</h2>
								<p>A server is a specialized type of computer or software system designed to provide services, resources, or data to other computers, known as clients, over a network./p>
									<h2>What dose a server do?</h2>
									<p>I like to use the term DRAEDS as a quick way to understand it </p>
								<p>Data Hosting: Servers can store and manage data, such as websites, databases, and files, and deliver them to clients when requested. For example, web servers host websites and serve web pages to browsers.</p>
								<p>Resource Sharing: Servers allow multiple clients to access shared resources like printers, files, or applications. For instance, a file server might hold documents that can be accessed by different users within an organization.</p>
								<p>Application Hosting: Servers can run and manage applications that clients use. For example, application servers might host software used by businesses to manage their operations.</p>
                                                                 <p>Email Handling: Email servers handle the sending, receiving, and storing of emails. They ensure that messages are delivered to the right recipients.</p>
								<p>Database Management: Database servers manage databases and respond to queries from clients. They handle the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in a structured way.</p>
								<p>Security and Authentication: Servers can manage user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources or data.</p>
								<p>Servers come in various forms, from large physical machines in data centers to virtual servers running on cloud platforms. The key idea is that they provide centralized resources or services that can be accessed by multiple clients across a network.</p>
								<h2>Setting up APACHE</h2>
								<p>Apache HTTP Server is a powerful and flexible web server solution used by millions of websites around the world. Its open-source nature, extensive configurability, and strong community support make it a reliable choice for both small projects and large-scale web hosting.</p>
								<h3>What is Apache HTTP Server?</h3>
                                                                <p>n Apache server, officially known as the Apache HTTP Server, is a widely used open-source web server software. It plays a crucial role in serving web pages to users' browsers over the Internet. Here's a quick rundown of what it does:

Serving Web Content: It handles requests from clients (like web browsers) and delivers web pages and other content from the server to the userâ€™s device.

Configuration and Flexibility: Apache is highly configurable and can be tailored to specific needs using its configuration files. This flexibility allows it to support a wide range of features and modules.

Modules: It uses modules to extend its capabilities. These modules can handle various tasks like URL rewriting, authentication, and server-side scripting (e.g., PHP).

Platform Compatibility: Apache is cross-platform, meaning it can run on different operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Security: It offers robust security features and can be configured to protect against various types of attacks.

Apache has been a staple of the web server landscape since its release in 1995 and remains popular due to its reliability and the extensive support community surrounding it.
